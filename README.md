grunt-handlebars
================

My grunt task for compiling handlebars templates - replaced the grunt-contrib handlebars task for me.

[grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt)

[grunt-contrib](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib)

Instructions: install grunt-contrib, replace the handblebars.js file in the current dir with this one.
